# Welp
Making invoices has never been easier! Create dynamic invoices in a couple of clicks. Your Welp dashboard includes a customer management system to directly send invoices to customers!

## How to Use
Visit [Welp dashboard](https://welp.it.com) and sign up using any of the supported platforms

#### Welp supports Apple, Google, Slack and email address for authentication

#### Important thing to be noted: Welp uses **Clerk** for authentication and accounts. So the login/signup component is not customizable from the repository and is only accessible through the Clerk account this project is connected to. 

This can be noticed in the authentication name given while logging in through Google. <img width="762" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6947cfcc-2fed-44e9-b9e0-b465174cfa44">

Once logged in, you are good to go!

To start adding invoice, you need to add bank account information first! Or just add random info to protect privacy. It's not like the bank account information is gonna show up in the invoice. Yeah you can just go ahead and add 0000000000 .

Once you are done with that, you can add as many amount of customers as you want and when making your invoice, you can just choose the customer you wanna send the invoice to! 
As for the invoice, you can add:
1. Subject/Title
2. Items
3. Item price/rate/quantity
**Note**: There is no limit of number of items you can add.

The dashboard also allows you to save your invoices forever and you can easily pull them up in the history tab, download them or email them to your customer directly from the dashboard.


## Customers
Welp also allows you to manage customers. Currently, we are not allowing deletion of customers.

## Some other things? I guess
You can also manage your account in the account details found in the top right corner of the website. In the account settings, you can view the devices your account was logged into so that you can keep track of sessions if multiple people are working on the same account. You can change username, profile photo, add or remove email addresses and connect your account to multiple authentications and last but not the least, manage passwords.

There is also organization support added now. You can now create organizations or teams of upto 5 members! This limit is subject to increase in future. A person can have "admin" privileges or "member" privileges in an organization.

If you ever want to delete your account, there is an option for that too! But please do let me know if you don't like something about the website or feel the need for a new feature and I will definitely work on adding that!
